            <p>Mild High Club is an American psychedelic pop group, led by the musician Alexander Brettin.</p>
            <p>Brettin grew up in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States">Midwest</a>, playing flute in his school band.

Brettin worked on Mild High Club's first album, <i>Timeline</i>, for almost three years until its release in 2015. His sophomore LP, <i>Skiptracing</i>, was released in 2016. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_(website)">Pitchfork</a> reviewed the album, stating <i> Skiptracing </i> is an improvement from <i>Timeline</i>, where "a more confident artist emerges with a fuller vision and voice."</p>
